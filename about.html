    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Ashley — a creative developer and designer who loves blending technical skill with artistic vision.  
      I’m passionate about building minimalist, visually polished web interfaces that feel professional and intuitive.  
      Whether it’s coding a theme toggle, designing a gradient background, or refining user experience, I enjoy making websites both functional and beautiful.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond web design, I explore music production, 3D modeling, and digital fabrication.  
      I’m inspired by bands like Linkin Park and enjoy experimenting with hybrid rock/electronic arrangements in BandLab.  
      I also dive into 3D printing projects, customizing STL files to bring ideas into the physical world.
    </p>

    <p>
      I thrive on challenges, whether it’s troubleshooting code, adapting to new creative tools, or finding elegant solutions under constraints.  
      My goal is to keep learning, iterating, and creating projects that combine clarity, consistency, and imagination.
