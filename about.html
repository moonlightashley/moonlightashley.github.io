  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I’m <strong>Ashley</strong> — a <strong>14‑year‑old content creator</strong> who thrives on blending creativity with technology. 
    From designing and experimenting with <strong>3D printing projects</strong> to building immersive fantasy worlds through writing, 
    I love bringing ideas to life in both digital and physical forms.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a storyteller, I expand chapters into rich, novel‑length scenes filled with layered characters and vivid detail. 
    As a maker, I enjoy formatting manuscripts with professional polish and designing websites that reflect a clean, modern aesthetic.
  </p>
  <p>
    Music is another cornerstone of my creativity — diving into <strong>rock and alternative trivia</strong>, following powerful vocalists, 
    and exploring the history of bands and collaborations fuels my inspiration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Curious, playful, and driven, I’m always learning new skills and finding fresh ways to share my work. 
    Whether through writing, design, or hands‑on projects, I’m building a creative journey that’s just getting started.
