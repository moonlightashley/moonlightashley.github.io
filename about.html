  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I’m <strong>Ashley</strong> — a <strong>content creator, creative developer, and designer</strong> who loves blending technical skill with artistic vision. 
    I’m passionate about building minimalist, visually polished web interfaces that feel professional and intuitive. 
    Whether it’s coding a theme toggle, designing a gradient background, or refining user experience, I enjoy making websites both functional and beautiful.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond web design, I explore <strong>music production, 3D modeling, and digital fabrication</strong>. 
    I’m inspired by bands like Linkin Park and enjoy experimenting with hybrid rock/electronic arrangements in BandLab. 
    I also dive into <strong>3D printing projects</strong>, customizing STL files to bring ideas into the physical world.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a storyteller, I expand chapters into rich, novel‑length scenes filled with layered characters and vivid detail. 
    As a maker, I enjoy formatting manuscripts with professional polish and designing websites that reflect a clean, modern aesthetic.
  </p>
  <p>
    Music is another cornerstone of my creativity — diving into <strong>rock and alternative trivia</strong>, following powerful vocalists, 
    and exploring the history of bands and collaborations fuels my inspiration.
  </p>
  <p>
    I thrive on challenges, whether it’s troubleshooting code, adapting to new creative tools, or finding elegant solutions under constraints. 
    My goal is to keep learning, iterating, and creating projects that combine clarity, consistency, and imagination.
